# Drawception-Profile-Downloader
Drawception is full of profiles with thousands of games... and thus thousands of lost memories.
Using this script built in Python, you can download your own or even other people's entire Drawception history. The script gathers every game, drawing, and caption the Drawceptioner made, and downloads it into a neat folder on your desktop.

(For the non-tech savvy, download the whole project, unpack it, and run the executable. The project also comes with the source code, if you want to read it or launch it using your own edition of Python!)
