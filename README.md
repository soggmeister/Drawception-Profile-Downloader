# Drawception-Profile-Downloader
Drawception is full of profiles with thousands of games... and lost memories.
Using this script built in Python, you can download anyone's or even your own Drawception drawings and captioms for viewing offline.
There are two versions:
1. Drawception Drawing Downloader, which downloads only the user's drawings.
2. Drawception Everything, which downloads captioned images, user drawings, and provides a summary of all game activity on Drawception.
